This is a bipedal humanoid robot walking control software system.

It's base on algorithms of "Locomotion Analysis and Control of a Miniature Bipedal Robot".

It's implemented in C++, which is more efficent, so it will fit embedded systems better.

This project will be implemented step by step, now I have finished SharedMemory, Simulation, Kinematics.

RobotModel(partially completed), Dynamics, MPC, WBC and StateEstimation will be done in the next couple of weeks or months.
